# Mandelbrot Set
## Description:
Program to calculate the mandelbrot set and print it to the screen that I developed in while taking a course at UNSW.

The function escapeSteps() is used to calculate whether a point exists in the mandelbrot set or not.
The function drawMandelbrot() is then used to call the functions in server.c which then converts the set into a 512 x 512 pixel bmp file. A range of bmp files are used to create a coherent image on the screen.

## Notes:
I am currently trying to develop a server.c file to be able to complete this project and display the mandelbrot set on the server of your choice.
